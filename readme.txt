This is GeoIPIFY integration for your WordPress website, which allows adding tooltips with geolocation information for each IP address in your post content or comments.

== Description ==

Get a prompt review of the geolocation data regarding all IPs on a given web page.

The 'IP geolocation Info' plugin automatically creates a tooltip containing relevant geolocation information. It also provides a link to a public report on IP geolocation API [website](https://geoipify.whoisxmlapi.com/) with regard to all the IPs both in the post text and the comments.

The tooltip is displayed when you hover the cursor over an IP address in the text. You can then carry out a more in-depth research into the IP's geolocation by following the link on IP Geolocation API website.

The tooltips are integrated simultaneously, and the 'IP Geolocation Info' plugin will not modify any of the content. You can deactivate it whenever you need to and then all of the siteâ€™s texts will look exactly as before.

If you have any additional questions that have not been covered, please feel free to email us at [support@whoisxmlapi.com](mailto:support@whoisxmlapi.com). We will do our best to get back to you within 1 business day.
